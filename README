if you wanna re-compile, below libs suggested setup firstly
	boost <better 1.56.0>
	zookeeper<better 3.4.5>
	log4cplus<better 1.1.2>

	NOTE: 
			for convenience, these static libs
			(libboost_date_time.a  
			 libboost_system.a  
			 libboost_thread.a  
			 liblog4cplus.a  
			 libzookeeper_mt.a  
			 libzoolock.a)
			have been put into thirdparty_*/libs and correspondly headers 
			(boost
			 log4cplus
			 zookeeper)
			have been put into thirdparty_*/include

		 	so if you wanna recompile, had better change Makefile
			(
			 src/sche/Makefile
			 src/base/utility/Makefile
			 src/base/zk_lib/Makefile
			)
			and set libs's path to your system
